useEffect is React’s mechanism for handling side effects in function components.

A side effect is anything that:
    - Interacts outside React
    - Runs after render
    - Is not pure calculation

Examples:
    API calls
    Timers
    Event listeners
    Subscriptions
    DOM manipulation
    Logging

useEffect(() => {
  // effect logic
});
